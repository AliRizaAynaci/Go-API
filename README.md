# Music API

This project provides a simple API for managing music albums. The API allows you to perform CRUD operations on albums.

## API Documentation

To view the API documentation, you can import the `api.yaml` file into tools like Postman or Swagger Editor.

## Usage

You can send HTTP requests to the following routes to interact with the API:

- `GET /albums`: Retrieve all albums.
- `POST /albums`: Add a new album.
- `GET /albums/{id}`: Retrieve a specific album.
- `PUT /albums/{id}`: Update a specific album.
- `DELETE /albums/{id}`: Delete a specific album.
